# Challenge 69: Hit the road Jack! | Tim & Alex apocalypse #5


## Task
You are given a number T the number of tests cases. T cases follow. For each case you are given a 2 dimensional array of numbers. Print out how many different 2x2 squares you can make using this given matrix.

## Examples
input
```
2
5 3
1 2 1
2 2 2
2 2 2
1 2 3
2 2 1
2 4
2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

output
```
6
1
```

## Explanation
in the first case you can have these squares:
```
1 2   2 1   2 2   2 3   2 2   2 2
2 2   2 2   2 2   2 1   1 2   2 3
```
that's 6 of them total

in the second case, there's only one possible square that can be made:
```
2 2
2 2
```
